# Hosted MCP — deployment setup

What an operator has to do once to bring a hosted teamctx MCP online. After
this, end users just paste a URL into their AI client and click **Connect** —
no tokens, no PATs, no files.

---

## 1. Create a GitHub OAuth App

<https://github.com/settings/developers> → **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Application name | `teamctx` |
| Homepage URL | `https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app` |
| Authorization callback URL | `https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/oauth/github/callback` |

Register, then **Generate a new client secret**. Keep the client ID and the
secret — the secret is shown once.

> Use an **OAuth App**, not a GitHub App. OAuth Apps issue the user-scoped
> `repo` token the MCP tools need, with no per-repo installation step.

## 2. Create the KV store

Vercel dashboard → your project → **Storage** → **Create Database** →
**KV** (Upstash Redis). Connect it to the project.

This injects `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` automatically. Upstash
directly also works — the code accepts `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` /
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` too.

Free tier is far more than enough: we store a few hundred bytes per user.

## 3. Set environment variables

Vercel project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**. Apply to
**Production** (and Preview if you test there).

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | from step 1 |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | from step 1 |
| `TEAMCTX_BASE_URL` | `https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app` — no trailing slash |

`KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` arrive from step 2; don't set them
by hand.

**Do not set** `TEAMCTX_ALLOW_URL_TOKENS`. It re-enables reading credentials
from the query string, which is for local development only — the MCP spec
prohibits it and Claude ignores such tokens anyway.

`TEAMCTX_BASE_URL` must match the host users actually type. If it disagrees
with the connector URL, the `resource` field in the metadata won't match and
the client will refuse to start the flow.

## 4. Redeploy and verify

Redeploy so the new environment variables are picked up, then:

```bash
curl https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/oauth/status
```

Expected:

```json
{ "oauthConfigured": true, "kvConfigured": true, "missing": [] }
```

Anything in `missing` names an environment variable that didn't arrive.

Then confirm the handshake starts correctly:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/api/mcp/<owner>/<repo> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Expected: `401`, plus a header of the form

```
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="teamctx", resource_metadata="https://…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp/<owner>/<repo>", scope="mcp:tools"
```

That 401 is not a failure — it is what tells the client where to authenticate.

---

## Using it (what an end user does)

1. Claude → **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**
2. URL: `https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/api/mcp/<owner>/<repo>`
3. **Connect** → GitHub consent screen → approve
4. Tools appear. Reads and writes work immediately.

For the seven tools that call a model — `ask`, `contribute`,
`submit_contribution`, `reflect`, `role_add`, `suggest_roles`,
`suggest_workstream_splits` — the user visits
`https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/settings` once, signs in with GitHub,
and saves an API key. The other 21 tools never need it.

---

## How it fits together

```
Claude ──POST /api/mcp/<owner>/<repo>──────► 401 + WWW-Authenticate
       ──GET  /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/…─► { authorization_servers }
       ──GET  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server─► { endpoints, S256, DCR }
       ──POST /register───────────────────► client_id                    [KV]
       ──GET  /authorize──────────────────► redirect to GitHub           [KV: pending]
User   ──approves at GitHub────────────────►
GitHub ──GET /oauth/github/callback────────► swap for GitHub token       [KV: code]
                                             redirect back with our code
       ──POST /token (PKCE)───────────────► access + refresh             [KV: token]
       ──POST /api/mcp/… + Bearer─────────► KV lookup → user's GitHub
                                             token → their repo
```

What lives in KV, and for how long:

| Key | Contents | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oauth:client:<id>` | DCR registration | none |
| `oauth:pending:<state>` | in-flight authorization | 10 min, one-shot |
| `oauth:code:<code>` | authorization code + GitHub token | 10 min, one-shot |
| `oauth:token:<token>` | GitHub token + profile | 1 hour |
| `oauth:refresh:<token>` | same, rotated on use | 90 days |
| `teamctx:aikey:<githubUserId>` | AI provider key | none |

The GitHub token never reaches the client, and never appears in a URL.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`/oauth/status` reports `oauthConfigured: false`** — an environment
variable is missing or the deploy predates it. Check `missing`, then redeploy.

**"Couldn't register with teamctx's sign-in service"** — the client couldn't
reach the metadata. Confirm `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` returns
JSON (not a 404 from a missing `vercel.json` rewrite), and that
`TEAMCTX_BASE_URL` matches the host in the connector URL.

**GitHub says "redirect_uri mismatch"** — the callback in the OAuth App must
be exactly `<TEAMCTX_BASE_URL>/oauth/github/callback`.

**Tools appear, but `ask`/`contribute` fail** — no AI key saved yet. Visit
`/settings`.

**Connection drops after about an hour** — expected; access tokens live one
hour and Claude refreshes on the 401. If refresh fails, check that `/token`
returns `error: "invalid_grant"` (not `invalid_request`) for an expired
refresh token — Claude branches on that code.

## Self-hosted alternative

If you'd rather not run OAuth at all, the same codebase works single-tenant:
deploy privately, put a GitHub token and AI key in environment variables, and
skip this document. One deployment then serves one repo with one set of
credentials. OAuth exists for the multi-tenant case — one URL, many users,
each with their own repo and their own keys.
