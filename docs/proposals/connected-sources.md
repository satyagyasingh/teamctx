# Proposal: connected sources

**Status:** Implemented · **Issue:** [#168](https://github.com/StatsLateral/teamctx/issues/168)
(the base for #169–#174, one per tool) · **Base:** `main`

## What the issue asks

The Settings **Connected sources** drawer shows sample data. Make it real: when
what an assistant read in Slack, Notion, Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox or
Coda reaches the project, leave a trace the manager can see — which tool, which
item, when, who brought it, and what it feeds. Links and short summaries only:
never file contents, never credentials. Stored in the team's own repository.

## Design

### The record

One file per item, `.teamctx/sources/<id>.json`, so two people recording at once
never touch the same line:

```
{ id, connector, title, link, itemId?, firstReadAt,
  feeds: [{ workstream, contribution, task?, at, by: { name, key }, summary, via }] }
```

- `id` is a hash of the connector and the link, else the tool's own item id,
  and only last the title. The same item read again gains a feed; two items
  that share a title stay apart whenever either is known.
- **What a contribution said about the item, who brought it and when live on
  its feed**, not on the item. So an item cited again never loses what an
  earlier contribution said, and a reader who can see only some feeds sees only
  what those said. (Changed after code review: the first version kept one
  summary and one name per item, which the latest citation, in any part of the
  work, overwrote.)
- **Written only once its contribution reaches the project** (queued or
  applied), just before that commit. A discarded or empty contribution leaves
  none.
- `connector` is one of `slack`, `notion`, `gdrive`, `m365`, `dropbox`, `coda`,
  or `other`.
- **Nothing that could carry a secret or a body is kept:**
  - there is no field for contents
  - a title is cut to 200 characters and a summary to 400
  - a link must be `http(s)`, and any query parameter that looks like a token
    (`token`, `key`, `secret`, `sig`, `code`, `auth`, `password`, …) is removed
    before it is written

### How a reference gets there

1. **Through the assistant.** `contribute` (people and agents) takes an
   optional `sources: [{ connector, title, link, summary }]`, for what the
   assistant read to write the contribution. Recorded as the contribution is
   logged, feeding its workstream (and its task, for work sent with
   `forTask`). teamctx holds no credential for the tool.
2. **Through `teamctx import`.** Each imported document leaves a reference for
   its connector, with the document's title, the link when the connector
   returns one (`url`), and the contribution's summary.

   The per-tool issues (#169–#174) make each connector return its item's link;
   this issue records whatever it gives.

### Who sees what

A reference is shown only for the parts of the work a reader can see:
- feeds outside their scope are dropped
- a reference with none left is not shown
- project-level feeds are visible to everyone with access
- a feed counts once its contribution is approved; the queue is the manager's,
  so a manager also sees feeds still waiting (marked as waiting), and nobody
  sees one that was turned down
- its summary, read date and who brought it come only from those visible feeds
- who brought it is shown as the roster names that key, or "someone"; a name
  the caller typed for themselves is never taken at its word

### The drawer

- Real references, grouped by tool as the sample is.
- Each item: title (linked), when it was last read, who brought it, and the
  parts of the work and tasks it feeds.
- The Settings link shows the real count.
- With none, it says plainly that nothing is connected, and keeps the sample
  below, still labelled as sample.

## Per tool

- **Slack (#169).** The shipped importer (`src/connectors/slack.js`, #22) is
  reused for auth, listing and fetching; Activepieces and Onyx were not needed.
  - `fetch` returns the thread's permalink, built from the workspace address
    that `auth.test` gives once per run.
  - It also returns a `sourceTitle` ("#pricing thread, 2023-11-14"), because the
    document's own title is the thread's first message, and a reference must
    not quote it.
  - Task numbers on a Slack reference arrive with #144's `forTask`.

## Existing open source first

- **Route 1** needs no library: the assistant already holds the tool's
  connector.
- **Route 2** records references inside the importers that already exist; it
  adds no new way of talking to the tools.
- **Deferred to the per-tool issues:** the Activepieces/Onyx spike the issue
  suggests is about replacing those hand-written importers. That is real work
  in its own right, and recording a reference does not depend on it.

## Plan

- [x] `src/sources.js`: the record, its clean-up (no secret, no body), upsert, and scope
- [x] Route 1: `sources` on `contribute` (people and agents)
- [x] Route 2: `teamctx import` records a reference per document
- [x] Page data and the drawer; the Settings count
- [x] Tests: shape, scope, no secret or file body ever written; CHANGELOG
