/**
 * The one thing a member reads before they do anything.
 *
 * Somebody joins, asks their assistant what to do, and the best answer
 * available was a bare list of task titles — no sense of what the project is
 * for, no sense of which part of it they are on, nothing saying "read this
 * first". So the assistant starts working: contributing, marking things done,
 * proposing changes to a tree it has never read.
 *
 * This is the second of the two governance rules in the design spec, the pair
 * to the gate in src/context-gate.js. That one guarantees there is something to
 * read; this is the reading. Either alone is worth little — a context nobody
 * opens is the same as no context.
 *
 * It spends no AI call, and that is a property rather than an implementation
 * detail. A member's assistant is told to open this first, every time, so the
 * cheapest and most frequent call in the product must not be the expensive one.
 * Everything here was compiled when it was written.
