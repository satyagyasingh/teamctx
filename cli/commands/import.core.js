 * Import local documents as proposed contributions.
 *
 * Each document becomes one contribution, distilled by the existing pipeline
 * and left in the manager's review queue. One-per-document keeps review
 * tractable and attribution honest: the queue entry says which file it came
 * from, and a bad import is rejected file by file rather than all or nothing.
 *
 * Nothing is ever applied directly. Import is exactly the path a typed
 * `teamctx contribute` takes, so the manager gate and role regeneration
 * already cover it — there is no second way into shared context.
