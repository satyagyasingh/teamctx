/**
 * Who is on this project.
 *
 * A teamctx project has a manager and, implicitly, anyone holding a clone — it
 * has never known who the team is. That leaves contributions attributed to
 * whatever `git config user.name` happens to say, and task owners as free text
 * where "Priya" and "priya" are two people.
 *
 * A member record reuses the actor key from src/actor.js rather than inventing
 * an identity scheme, so a member joins up with the contributions they have
 * already made and with the authorKey grouping `teamctx stats` counts by.
 *
 * Members are project-wide by default. A member may instead be scoped to named
 * workstreams, which is enforced for anyone reaching the project through the
 * server on its lent credential — they have no repository access of their own,
 * so the server is their only path. For anyone holding a clone it stays what it
 * always was, a label over a repo they can read in full; `addMember` says so
 * rather than implying a wall that is not there. See src/member-scope.js.
