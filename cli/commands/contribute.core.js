/**
 * Where a contribution came from, as a commit trailer.
 *
 * `git log .teamctx/` is the audit trail — it is what `teamctx stats` will
 * walk, and what someone reads when asking "where did this come from". Only
 * `mcp` was ever named there, so an imported contribution was indistinguishable
 * from a typed one even though the record knew the answer.
 *
 * In the body rather than the subject: a Slack source is
 * `import:slack:C0BPPEJVBV4/p1786543526387459`, and truncating it to fit a
 * subject line would destroy the one property that makes it worth recording —
 * that you can follow it back to the artifact.
 *
 * `cli` is the default and says nothing, because noting it on every commit
 * would be noise.
